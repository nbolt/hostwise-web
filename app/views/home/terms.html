Any controversy, claim or dispute between Contractor and the Company (and/or its affiliated entities and/or its or their owners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents) arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, the termination and/or any alleged breach thereof, the relationship of the parties, and/or any services or work (including the Services) Contractor has provided, including, without limitation, claims for breach of any express or implied contract, tort claims, claims for violation of any federal, state or other governmental constitution, law, statute, ordinance, or regulation, and any and all claims related to compensation, discrimination or harassment, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration as the exclusive remedy for such controversy, claim or dispute, regardless of whether such dispute is initiated by Contractor or the Company.  The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator selected by the parties.  Except as modified or supplemented by the terms of this mutual arbitration agreement, the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (the "Rules").  A copy of these Rules may be obtained from the Company or on-line at www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration.  Contractor acknowledges that it/he/she was offered the opportunity to review the Rules and obtain a copy of them before signing this mutual arbitration agreement.  In arbitration, both parties may conduct discovery to the same extent as would be permitted in court, and both parties may be represented by an attorney.  The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written award that explains the legal and factual basis for the arbitrator's decision on all claims and defenses presented to the arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall have full authority to award all relief and remedies which would otherwise be available in court, including, but not limited to, monetary damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, penalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and exemplary damages when authorized by applicable law.  The Company shall pay the arbitrator's fees and any JAMS administrative expenses.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    </p>
    <p class="gray">
      The court, not the arbitrator, shall have the power to rule on the arbitrator's jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of this mutual arbitration agreement.  Nothing in this mutual arbitration agreement shall prevent either party from seeking a preliminary injunction (or other provisional remedy) in court which preserves the status quo before the arbitrator issues his/her award.  Claims in arbitration shall be filed and maintained only on an individual basis.  This means that Contractor must bring its/his/her own claims (and only its/his/her own claims) in arbitration, and the Company must bring its claims (and only its claims) in arbitration.  Contractor may not file or maintain any claim in arbitration or in court as a representative for or on behalf of other contractors or individuals, jointly or collectively with other contractors, or as a named plaintiff/claimant or member in any purported class or collective proceeding.  Likewise, the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a class or collective arbitration proceeding.
    </p>
    <p class="gray">
      This mutual arbitration agreement supersedes and replaces any and all other prior arbitration agreements which Contractor has entered into with the Company.  If any provision of this mutual arbitration agreement is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
    </p>
    <p class="gray">
      To preserve the integrity of the arbitration process, if a dispute between the parties includes one or more claims that are covered by this mutual arbitration agreement and one or more claims that are not subject to arbitration, the court shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on the covered claim(s), shall not stay the arbitration of the covered claim(s), but shall stay the litigation of any claims that are not subject to arbitration until the arbitration of the covered claim(s) is completed.
    </p>
    <p class="gray">
      This mutual arbitration agreement is enforceable in state and federal courts, and is subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.  By signing this Agreement, both parties acknowledge that they have carefully read this mutual arbitration agreement, agree to be bound by its terms, and acknowledge that they are entering into this mutual arbitration agreement voluntarily and not in reliance on any promises or representations made by the other party other than those contained in this Agreement.
